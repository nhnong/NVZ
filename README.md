# Submission for WIT Hackathon 2025: Future in Focus 

## Description
TRACK 2: ORGANISE AND OPTIMIZE
We developed OptiMate, a productivity and real-time seat availability tracker for libraries at UniMelb. 
We aim to solve a common issue shared by university students, being unable to find a library spot in a timely manner.

## Live website
https://withack.vercel.app/

## Running the project:

Installations required: 
- Node.js version 20 and above
- npm install (intalling dependencies)

Cloning the repository: https://github.com/nhnong/NVZ.git

- npm run dev (local server)

## Technologies involved:
Next.js, Typescript, React, HTML, git

## Technical considerations- 
- Utilised next.js environment with each page linked to the main page.tsx that has all the pages directory
- Utilised layout.tsx for consistent header layout and routing

## Key features
Implementation of timer & to-do-list:
- The timer and to-do list page combines two features for a simpler structure, allowing users to input tasks and mark them off as they finish it while seeing the Pomodoro timer at the same time. This design helps users focus on the foremost task and optimise time without having the distraction of switching tabs

Implementation of libraries page:
- Each library is stored as its own card and can be accessed through the homepage, either through scrolling down, using the search bar or filtering search. The home page utilises a simple layout allowing users to search for the desired library based on key features, including whether charging is available, food allowed, noise level desired and seating types. Within each library page, users can view real time the number for specific types of seats and decide where to go. 

## In relation to chosen track:
From the existence of the University of Melbourne's Study space availability page, it can be inferred that there are possible implementations of such ideas in real life where either monitors logged in or sensors can be used additionally to track the availability of seatings within a space. Our take on productive prioritizes user's optimal study experiences for the following criterias. Filters and searching features allow time efficiency in making decisions for an optimal study space, a timer using Pomodoro method and streaks counter as motivation booster, and finally a to-do list to manage daily routines, tasks and study goals easier.
